Section 1. Overview:

Collabify is the first platform built to bring trust, clarity, and speed to brand–creator collaborations. In today’s fragmented marketing world, deals are buried in DMs, email chains, and endless back-and-forths, leaving both creators and brands frustrated and vulnerable to ghosting or miscommunication. Collabify eliminates that friction by providing a single, trusted layer where verified profiles, intelligent matching, seamless messaging, and automated contracts work together. Whether you’re a micro-influencer looking to monetize your audience or a brand seeking reliable collaborators, Collabify ensures every connection starts on solid ground.

More than just a marketplace, Collabify is the relationship infrastructure of the creator economy. Users can swipe to discover compatible collaborators, generate and sign NDAs or contracts in seconds, and secure payments through escrow systems, all within a sleek, modern interface. Public collaboration pages, gamified trust badges, and AI-driven recommendations create network effects that reward reliability and performance. With Collabify, brands and creators don’t just make deals—they build trust, credibility, and long-term partnerships in a chaotic, fast-moving industry.

Milestones & Mapping (quick view)

MVP (0–6m): A1–A4, B1–B3, C1–C3, D1–D3, F1–F2, L1–L2, K1, M1 (essential admin), basic payments E1 (sandbox).

Phase 2 (6–12m): H1 (AI recommender), F3 (public collab cards), G1–G2 (gamification & score), I1 (Pro), L3–L4 (growth).

Phase 4 (Years 3–5): Advanced AI negotiator H2, globalization + localization, Collabify Academy, marketplace.

Prioritization rules (how to pick next sprint)

Critical path first: profiles → messaging → matching → contract (that enables a real collaboration).

If blocked on external integrations (DocuSign, Stripe), build a minimal internal flow to simulate and validate product.

Parallelize legal/security/admin work to avoid rework.

Suggested Sprint cadence & sizing

2-week sprints, team of: 1–2 FE devs (React), 1 BE dev (Node/Express), 1 designer (UI/UX), 1 PM/Founder.

Plan 3–5 stories per sprint (total ~13–20 SP) early on until velocity stabilizes.
